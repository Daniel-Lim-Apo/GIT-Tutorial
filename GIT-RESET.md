# Git Reset: Understanding `--soft` and `--hard`

`git reset` is a powerful Git command that allows you to undo changes in your repository by moving the `HEAD` pointer to a previous commit. Depending on the options you use, it can affect your working directory, the staging area (index), and the commit history.

In this tutorial, we'll explore two common options used with `git reset`: `--soft` and `--hard`.

## What is `git reset`?

The `git reset` command is used to undo changes in a Git repository by resetting the current `HEAD` to a specific state. It can be used with different options to control what happens to the working directory and the staging area.

### Syntax

```bash
git reset [option] <commit>
```

    [option]: Controls how the reset affects the working directory and the staging area.
    <commit>: Specifies which commit to reset to.

## Commonly Used Options

    --soft: Only moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit without changing the working directory or the staging area.
    --hard: Resets everythingâ€”moves the HEAD pointer, resets the staging area, and changes the working directory to match the specified commit.
